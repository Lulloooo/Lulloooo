Well, I've been asking myself that for a long time. 🤣  
Jokes aside, I'm a **business and data analyst** 📈 with a knack for crunching numbers like they’re potato chips and solving business mysteries with my Master's degree in Economics and Finance (with a side of top-notch grades).🎓  
I love turning data into stories and deciphering business enigmas! 🔍

## 🪄 Analytical Wizardry
Let's be honest here: I may not code like a pro and sometimes my code can get a bit messy at times. But one thing is always clear: the data-driven insights from my analysis are always spot-on. 🎯  
From R and SQL to Excel and Python, I have a pretty loaded toolbox at my disposal. Plus, my understanding of statistics and business adds an extra layer of analytical finesse.

# 📦 What's in the box?

## 🎨 Creative Analysis with a dash of Humor
Who says data can't be fun?  
Prepare to be dazzled by out-of-the-box analysis and data visualizations that are as beautiful as they are informative. Remember to be always ready for some quirky commentary and the occasional data-driven joke to keep things light. 😜  

### 🔝 What I'm Into

If it sparks  my interest ✨, you can bet I'll analyze it to bits! Some stuffs that tickle my fancy are:

- 💸 Finance & Economics (Because who doesn't love crunching numbers and talking markets?) 💸
- ♻️ Environemnt & the Green Sector (Saving the planet, one dataset at a time!) ♻️
- 💻 Technology (Gadgets, gizmos, and all things tech—bring it on!) 💻
- 🕹️ Videogames (spoiler: I am a really bad at these) 🕹️
- 🎧 Hip-Hop Music 🎧
- ⚽️ Sports, especially football (like a true Italian) ⚽️
- 💬 Coffee chats and being around people (that’s one thing I can’t quite analyze, I love it tho) 💬
