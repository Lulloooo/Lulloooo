Well, I've been asking myself that for a long time. 🤣  
Jokes aside, I'm a **business and data analyst** 📈 with a knack for crunching numbers like they’re potato chips and solving business mysteries with my Master's degree in Economics and Finance (with a side of top-notch grades).🎓  
I love turning data into stories and deciphering business enigmas! 🔍

## 🪄 Analytical Wizardry
Let's be honest here: I may not code like a pro and sometimes my code can get a bit messy at times. But one thing is always clear: the data-driven insights from my analysis are always spot-on. 🎯  
From R and SQL to Excel and Python, I have a pretty loaded toolbox at my disposal. Plus, my understanding of statistics and business adds an extra layer of analytical finesse.

## 🎨 Creative Analysis with a dash of Humor
Who says data can't be fun?  
Prepare to be dazzled by out-of-the-box analysis and data visualizations that are as beautiful as they are informative. Remember to be always ready for some quirky commentary and the occasional data-driven joke to keep things light. 😜  
Still on the fence❓Check my **[BizData-Nexus](https://github.com/Lulloooo/BizData-Nexus.git)** 📊

## 🤖 Coding Adventures 
I know, someone could find coding boring. Well, for me it is like an adventure 🗺️  
Whether I’m tinkering with a new language, solving a fun problem, or just trying to automate something in my life, you'll find those adventures in my **[Coding-Projects-Hub](https://github.com/Lulloooo/Coding-Projects-Hub.git) 📁**  
I might not be a full-fledged developer, but I genuinely enjoy diving into code from time to time. Lucky for me, I love challenges 💪🏼  
<p style="margin-top: 100px;">

## 🗞️ Some Articles... Here and There
I love talking about things. Sometimes, I even write about them. And on rare occasions, what I’ve written gets published somewhere 📰  
It could be an article for a newspaper, an NGO’s annual report, or a think tank paper, but you can bet it will be awarded its **own repo 🗂️** on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Lulloooo?tab=repositories) 🐈‍⬛  
Just check the titles (_i.e. the repo name_), choose the ones that intrigue you most, and dive into the corresponding repo. You'll find the final article 📝, information on where it was published 📰, and, where possible, the analysis code 🔢  
The fun part? You might stumble upon something interesting 💡

# 👥 Geek Out with me
Whether you are a fellow data analyst, a finance guru or just someone who shares my passions' cocktail, I'd love to **[connect with you](https://www.linkedin.com/in/la-databizanalyst/) 🤝🏼**
